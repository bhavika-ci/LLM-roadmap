## 📋 Learning Objective

**To understand how to use LLM models and Google CLI coding agent to develop RAG/Chroma database-based applications**

## 🎯 Course Overview

This comprehensive roadmap covers essential concepts and practical skills needed to build sophisticated applications using Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and vector databases. By the end of this course, you'll be able to create production-ready applications that leverage the power of modern AI technologies.

## 📅 Timeline
- **Start Date**: Current
- **Due Date**: September 9, 2025
- **Duration**: Self-paced learning with structured milestones

## 🎓 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Fundamentals (Topics 1-2)
- Understand what LLMs are and how they work
- Learn about RAG and its applications

### Phase 2: Core Technologies (Topics 3-4)
- Master vector databases and their types
- Understand embeddings and their role

### Phase 3: Development Tools (Topics 5-6)
