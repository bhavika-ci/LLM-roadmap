## 1. Fundamentals: What Are LLMs?

Before you can build with LLMs, you need to understand the basic concepts behind them.

### The "Word Predictor" Idea
Start by grasping the core function. An LLM's goal is to predict the next token (a word or part of a word) in a sequence.

### Training Data
Understand that the quality and quantity of the data they are trained on (billions of pages of text) are what give them their power.

### Key Components
Learn the simple definitions of:

- **Tokens**: How text is broken down into small units
- **Context Window**: The limited number of tokens the model can "remember" at one time
- **Transformer Architecture**: The specific type of neural network that makes modern LLMs so effective. You don't need to know the complex math, just the general idea that it allows the model to look at the entire sentence at once, not just word-by-word

## 2. Prompt Engineering: Learning to "Talk" to an LLM

This is the most practical and important skill for a beginner. It's the art of writing effective prompts to get the best possible response.

### Basic Prompting
Learn to ask clear and specific questions.

### Zero-Shot Prompting
Giving a prompt with no examples. For example, "Translate this to French: Hello."

### Few-Shot Prompting
Giving a prompt with a few examples to guide the model. For example, "The capital of France is Paris. The capital of Japan is Tokyo. What is the capital of Italy?"

### Chain-of-Thought
Asking the model to "think step-by-step" to get a more accurate and logical answer.

## 3. Practical Application: Using LLM APIs

This is where you get hands-on experience without needing to train a model yourself.

### Explore Public APIs
Use the free or low-cost APIs from major providers like:
- OpenAI (GPT)
- Google (Gemini)
- Anthropic (Claude)

### Build Simple Projects
Start with small, fun projects like:
- A basic chatbot
- A text summarizer
- A tool that generates creative writing based on your prompts

### Understand Integrations
Learn how to connect an LLM to a simple app you build using Python or another programming language.

## 4. Advanced Concepts (Optional for a beginner)

Once you're comfortable with the basics, you can start to dig deeper into more complex topics.

### Fine-Tuning
The process of training a pre-existing model on a smaller, specific dataset to make it better at a particular task (e.g., training it on legal documents to make a legal assistant).

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
This is a technique that gives an LLM access to external, private data (like your company's documents) so it can generate answers based on up-to-date, accurate information rather than just its general training data.

## 5. Key Technologies and Tools

### What is RAG?

RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a technique that gives a Large Language Model (LLM) access to up-to-date or specific external information. Think of it like a student who can't remember an answer: the student doesn't guess; they look up the correct information in a textbook and then answer the question using that information. RAG works the same way: it first retrieves relevant information from a separate knowledge base and then uses that information to generate a more accurate response.

### What is a Vector Database?

A vector database is a type of database designed to store, manage, and search for embeddings (numerical representations of data). Unlike traditional databases that search for exact matches, a vector database finds data points that are "closest" to a query vector, which means they are semantically similar.

#### Types of Vector Databases

The types of vector databases are often categorized by their architecture and deployment model:

1. **Dedicated Vector Databases**: These are built specifically for vector search and nothing else (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate)
2. **Vector Search Engines**: These are open-source libraries or engines that can be embedded into an application or used with other databases (e.g., Faiss, Annoy)
3. **Hybrid Databases**: These are traditional databases that have added a vector search capability as a feature (e.g., PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension)

### What are Embeddings?

Embeddings are numerical representations of words, phrases, or entire documents. They convert human-readable text into a list of numbers (a vector) that captures the semantic meaning and relationships of the original text. For example, the words "king" and "queen" would have very similar embedding vectors because they are semantically related, while "king" and "car" would be very different. These vectors are what vector databases use to perform their searches.

### What is LangChain?

LangChain is a popular framework for building applications with LLMs. It's used because it simplifies complex tasks by allowing developers to chain different components together. Instead of writing all the code from scratch, you can use LangChain to connect an LLM to a vector database, a search tool, or a custom function. It provides a structured way to manage the flow of data and logic, making it much easier to build sophisticated applications like chatbots, document summarizers, or question-answering systems.

### What is Docker?

A Docker container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run an application: the code, a runtime, libraries, and settings. Think of it like a standardized shipping container for software. It ensures your application will run exactly the same way, regardless of the environment it's deployed in.

#### How to set up and create new Docker containers:

1. **Install Docker**: Download and install the Docker Desktop application for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
2. **Create a Dockerfile**: In your project's root directory, create a file named `Dockerfile`. This file contains instructions on how to build your container image
3. **Build the Image**: Open your terminal in the project directory and run the command: `docker build -t your-app-name .`
4. **Run the Container**: Once the image is built, you can create and run a new container from it with the command: `docker run your-app-name`

### What is Google Gemini CLI?

The Google Gemini Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a developer tool that allows you to interact directly with Google's Gemini LLMs from your computer's terminal. It's used for quickly testing prompts, generating text or code, or performing simple tasks without needing to write a full application. It's a convenient tool for rapid prototyping and scripting with the Gemini models.
